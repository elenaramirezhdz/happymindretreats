## Design

### Colour Scheme

It's a clean website, I used white background color and the colors to highlight for buttons and cover text: 

* I have used `#f46e06 ` & `rgba(96, 108, 32, 0.6)` as the primary and secondary colours used for the site buttons and cover-text.
* I have used `rgba(96, 108, 32, 0.6)` as the overlay used over the sites background image for the cover text.


### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

* For the Page Title and headings I have used the google font [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display?query=play). It's a serif font.


* For the body of the page I have used the google font [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans). Noto Sans is a sans-serif font which has very precise and clean lines. I have chosen to use a sans-serif font for the body of the page as studies have found that sans-serif fonts are generally more legible to read on a screen.


### Imagery

It's a website about yoga and coaching retreats, so I used several photos of me doing yoga and photos of the sea in Mexico from Pexels.com  


### Features

The website is comprised of a home page, an about page, a retreats page and a contact page.

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:

* A favicon in the browser tab.

* The title of the site at the top of every page. This title also acts as a link back to the home page.


#### The Home Page

The home page shows the benefits of Happy Mind Yoga retreats, it tells what the customer will get when going on a yoga and coaching retreat. 


#### The About Page

It's a page about the founder of the Happy Mind retreats with a short text and a photo of the founder doing yoga.

#### The Retreats Page

On this page you can find a short text motivating to go on a yoga and coaching retreat and photos of Cancún, beautiful location for the retreat.

#### The Contact Page

It's a page with a contact form and a header photo, very simple and practical. Here the user can send me a message to register for the retreat.


### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
* Choosing a sans serif font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
* I used alt attribute for the images.

Text from Code Insititute

![CI logo](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fullstack/ci_logo_small.png)

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. If you are using Gitpod then you need [this template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) instead.  We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **July 26th, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

Happy coding!
